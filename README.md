# A Short Lecture on Object Oriented Programming OOP with Javascript
This repository was created as a learning tool to explore Object Oriented Programing(OOP) with Javascript. Naturally, cats were chosen to create a use-case for this fundamental programming skill! 🐈 ✨

### What this Interactive App does...
The finished example of this app can be found in the `client` folder of this repository. There, open `index.html` in your browser to explore the final app!
- Start by clicking a cat!
- You should get a nice message as an `alert` from the cat you clicked. This cat is an object!
- The cat's object was build dynamically with javascript's special `Class` function which is used as a template for creating Objects.
  - Learn more about Javascript Classes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
- The cat's object can also be modified. Try using your arrow keys or click the arrow buttons to move the cat around the grid! 🐈🐾🐾🐾🐾
- Hey, why not interact with other cats!?

_Be sure to checkout your browser's console to see the current state of the objects as you click the cats._
