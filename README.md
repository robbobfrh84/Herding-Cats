# A Short Lecture on Object Oriented Programming OOP with Javascript
This repository was created as a learning tool to explore Object Oriented Programing(OOP) with Javascript. Naturally, cats were chosen to create a use-case for this fundamental programming skill! 🐈 ✨

### What this Interactive App does...
The finished example of this app can be found in the `client` folder of this repository. There, open `index.html` in your browser to explore the final app!
- Start by clicking a cat!
- You should get a nice message as an `alert` from the cat you clicked. This cat is an object!
- The cat's object was build dynamically with javascript's special `Class` function which is used as a template for creating Objects.
  - Learn more about Javascript Classes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
- The cat's object can also be modified. Try using your arrow keys or click the arrow buttons to move the cat around the grid! 🐈🐾🐾🐾🐾

### How to "walk through" the process of how this app was built!

# Lession Prep Plan
The following is a journal of my process

- ✅ - Brainstorm ideas & pick subject:
  - I picked OOP and decided to use Javascript for my lecture. I love OOP as i think it's a great way to real-world life to code. It's also an important fundamental concept to gain a strong understanding of for students new to coding!
- ✅ - Create base code and test idea
  - For a visual illustration, I created a grid a plotted the cats to demonstrate a fun use-case.
- [ ] - Create user/student story of lesson.
  - Basic Object: Useful variable type!
  - Using Class: A template to dynamically create objects.
    - Visualization demonstrations and tinkering with vars/adding __proto__
- [ ] - Script lesson w/ student interaction prompts.
