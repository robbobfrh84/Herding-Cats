# Lession Prep Plan
The following is a journal of my process

- ✅ - Brainstorm ideas & pick subject:
  - I picked OOP and decided to use Javascript for my lecture. I love OOP as i think it's a great way to real-world life to code. It's also an important fundamental concept to gain a strong understanding of for students new to coding!
- ✅ - Create base code and test idea
  - For a visual illustration, I created a grid a plotted the cats to demonstrate a fun use-case.
- ✅ - Create user/student story of lesson.
  - Basic Object: Useful variable type!
  - Using Class: A template to dynamically create objects.
    - Visualization demonstrations and tinkering with vars/adding __proto__
- ✅ - Script lesson w/ student interaction prompts.
