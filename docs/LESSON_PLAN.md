# Lession Prep Plan
The following is a journal of my process

- âœ… - Brainstorm ideas & pick subject:
  - I picked OOP and decided to use Javascript for my lecture. I love OOP as i think it's a great way to real-world life to code. It's also an important fundamental concept to gain a strong understanding of for students new to coding!
- âœ… - Create base code and test idea
  - For a visual illustration, I created a grid a plotted the cats to demonstrate a fun use-case.
- âœ… - Create user/student story of lesson.
  - Basic Object: Useful variable type!
  - Using Class: A template to dynamically create objects.
    - Visualization demonstrations and tinkering with vars/adding __proto__
- âœ… - Script lesson w/ student interaction prompts.


# Lesson plan notes...

### 1.html & 1.js
- So I'm going to be doing a little lecture on Object Oriented Programing
- I created this lecture thinking that, perhaps it's early learners in their...
  - ...1st or 2nd week of javascript, have basic var types, functions etc..
- And we're going to have a bit of fun and walk through
  - An application that's build using, Object Oriented Programing
  -  OR: OOP has it's commonly referred to.
- AND, it's not specific to Javascript!
- As you'll see it can be as much of a strategy for developing
  - not just a tool
- So, let's take a quick look at a simple object...
 - `1.js` > ... ðŸŽ™ðŸ—£

### 2
- Objects can have functions!
- And, we access those functions the same way... dot notation

### 3
- Now lets create a few cats to work with.
- At this point, maybe some of you are gimmacing.
- And, may have heard a often used acrynym DRY.
 - Do not repeat yourself.
- And, what we see her is a lot of repeating ourselves.

### 4
- Notice the prototype

ðŸ”¥ NOW, let's explore a little bit more about how OOP can be developed to make a more INTERACTIVE application...

- FIRST move to 5.js, stay on 4.html
### 5
- we've got some info about our cats, actions,
- WHAT ABOUT a location.
- Demonstrate hard coded move

### FINAL
- Another really cool thing...(looping!)
